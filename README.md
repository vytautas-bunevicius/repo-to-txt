## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Ensure that [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) is installed on your system. The tool is compatible with Go version 1.16 and above.
- **Git**: Required for cloning repositories. Ensure that [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed and available in your system's PATH.

## Installation

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vytautas-bunevicius/repo-to-txt.git
   cd repo-to-txt
   ```

2. **Build the Executable**

   ```sh
   go build -o repo-to-txt main.go
   ```

   This command compiles the Go program and generates an executable named `repo-to-txt` in the current directory.

### Making repo-to-txt Globally Accessible

To run `repo-to-txt` from any directory, you need to add the directory containing the executable to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

**Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS):**

1. **Move the executable to a directory in your PATH:**
   Common locations include `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`.
   ```sh
   sudo mv repo-to-txt /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. **Alternatively, add the executable's current directory to your PATH:**
   Open your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) and add the following line, replacing `/path/to` with the actual path to the executable:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to"
   ```
   Then, reload the shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

**Windows:**

1. **Move the executable to a directory in your PATH:**
   You can find the directories in your PATH by searching for "environment variables" in the Start menu and selecting "Edit the system environment variables".

2. **Alternatively, add the executable's current directory to your PATH:**
   Follow the instructions in the "Edit the PATH variable" section of the Windows instructions above.

## Usage

`repo-to-txt` can be used in two modes:

1. **Interactive Mode**: Prompts the user step-by-step for necessary inputs.
2. **Command-Line Flags**: Allows users to provide all inputs upfront for automation and scripting.

### Interactive Mode

Simply run the executable without any flags, and the tool will guide you through the process.

```sh
repo-to-txt
```

**Sample Interaction:**

```
Welcome to repo-to-txt!
Enter the GitHub repository URL (HTTPS or SSH): https://github.com/vytautas-bunevicius/web-comment-monitor.git
? Select authentication method:  [Use arrow keys]
‚ùØ No Authentication
  HTTPS with PAT
  SSH
Enter the output directory: /path/to/output
Enter folders to exclude (comma-separated, leave empty to include all): vendor, tests
Enter file extensions to include (comma-separated, leave empty to include all): .go,.md
Repository contents written to /path/to/output/web-comment-monitor.txt
```

### Command-Line Flags

Provide necessary inputs via flags to run the tool non-interactively.

```sh
repo-to-txt -repo=<repository_url> -auth=<authentication_method> [additional_flags]
```

**Available Flags:**

- `-repo`: **(Required)** GitHub repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
- `-auth`: Authentication method. Options: `none`, `https`, `ssh`.
- `-username`: GitHub username (required for HTTPS).
- `-pat`: GitHub Personal Access Token (required for HTTPS).
- `-ssh-key`: Path to SSH private key (required for SSH).
- `-ssh-passphrase`: Passphrase for SSH private key (if protected).
- `-output-dir`: The directory where the output file should be saved. Defaults to the current directory.
- `-exclude`: Comma-separated list of folders to exclude from the output.
- `-include-ext`: Comma-separated list of file extensions to include (e.g., `.go,.md`). If not set, defaults to excluding certain non-code files like `.ipynb`.
- `-version`: Print the version number and exit.

**Note**: The output file is automatically named after the repository (e.g., `repository-name.txt`).

## Excluding Specific Folders

You can specify folders that you want to exclude from the `.txt` output. This can be done either interactively or via command-line flags.

### Interactive Exclusions

When running the tool in interactive mode, after selecting the authentication method, you will be prompted to enter folders to exclude.

**Sample Interaction:**

```
Enter folders to exclude (comma-separated, leave empty to include all): vendor, tests
```

### Command-Line Exclusions

Use the `-exclude` flag followed by a comma-separated list of folder names to exclude.

**Usage Example:**

```sh
repo-to-txt -repo=https://github.com/vytautas-bunevicius/web-comment-monitor.git -auth=none -output-dir=/path/to/output -exclude="vendor,tests"
```

## Including Specific File Extensions

By default, the tool excludes non-code files like `.ipynb`. You can specify which file extensions to include using the `-include-ext` flag.

### Command-Line Inclusion

Use the `-include-ext` flag followed by a comma-separated list of file extensions to include only those files in the output.

**Usage Example:**

```sh
repo-to-txt -repo=https://github.com/vytautas-bunevicius/web-comment-monitor.git -auth=none -output-dir=/path/to/output -include-ext=".go,.md"
```

**Note**: If `-include-ext` is not set, the tool defaults to excluding non-code files such as `.ipynb`.

## Authentication Methods

### No Authentication

Use this method to clone **public** repositories without providing any authentication details.

**Usage Example:**

```sh
repo-to-txt -repo=https://github.com/vytautas-bunevicius/web-comment-monitor.git -auth=none -output-dir=/path/to/output
```

### HTTPS Authentication with PAT

Use this method to clone **private** repositories using your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (PAT).

**Usage Example:**

```sh
repo-to-txt -repo=https://github.com/your-username/private-repo.git -auth=https -username=your_username -pat=your_PAT -output-dir=/path/to/output
```

**Security Note**: Be cautious when using command-line flags to provide sensitive information like PATs, as they can be exposed in process listings. Consider using environment variables or interactive prompts for improved security.

### SSH Authentication

Use this method to clone **private** repositories using SSH keys.

**Usage Example:**

```sh
repo-to-txt -repo=git@github.com:your-username/private-repo.git -auth=ssh -ssh-key=/path/to/id_rsa -ssh-passphrase="your_passphrase" -output-dir=/path/to/output -exclude="vendor,tests"
```

**Prerequisites**:

- Ensure that your SSH key is added to your GitHub account.
- The default SSH key path is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. If your key is located elsewhere, specify the path using the `-ssh-key` flag.
- If your SSH key is protected with a passphrase, provide it using the `-ssh-passphrase` flag. If your key does not have a passphrase, you can omit this flag.

## Examples

## Error Handling

The tool provides descriptive error messages to help you troubleshoot issues. Common errors include:

- **Invalid Repository URL**: Ensure that the repository URL is correct and accessible.
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify your authentication credentials or SSH key.
- **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to clone the repository and write to the output directory.
- **SSH Passphrase Errors**: If using an SSH key with a passphrase, ensure that the passphrase is correct.

**Example Error Message:**

```
2024/09/13 10:43:38 Error cloning/pulling repository: failed to pull repository: invalid auth method
```

**Resolution**:

- If cloning a **public** repository, select "No Authentication" to avoid unnecessary authentication errors.
- Ensure that your PAT has the necessary scopes if using HTTPS authentication.
- Verify that your SSH key is correctly added to your GitHub account if using SSH authentication.
- If your SSH key is passphrase-protected, ensure that the correct passphrase is provided.
